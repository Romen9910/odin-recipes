# odin-recipes

This project is a simple Recipe Website that showcases popular Nigerian dishes.
The website includes a homepage (index.html) that provides links to different recipe pages.

The dishes featured are:
-Egusi soup
-Jollof Rice
-Ogbono Soup

Each recipe page provides details about the dish, and users can easily navigate between pages using links.

## What I Have Learned So Far

Throughout this project, I have gained valuable skills in HTML, including:

Creating multiple Html pages and structuring a website.

Using **links** (<a>tags) to navigate between different pages.

Organizing files and folders properly for better project structure.

This project has helped me understand how websites are built and how pages connect through links.
I look forward to improving my web development skills.
